# Howdy, I'm Yifan Shen

👨‍💻 I am one of the [Core ML Tools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools) developers starting from 2023. 

👨‍💻 I was a PyTorch intern in summber 2022, worked on [nested tensor](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/nestedtensor)

👨‍🎓 I was a quantum chemistry Ph. D. until fall 2022, worked on empowering quantum chemistry with machine learning.

🔭 Looking forward to make the world more computable:
* For large models that can only live on cloud currently, let's compress them and deploy to edge devices!
* For humongous challenges posted by nature and physical laws, that can't even live on cloud, let's develop some more efficient algorithms!
