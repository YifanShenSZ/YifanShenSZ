# Howdy, I'm Yifan Shen

👨‍💻 I am a [Core ML Tools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools) developer starting from 2023. One sample of my work here is [Core ML on-device Llama](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/core-ml-on-device-llama)

👨‍💻 I was a [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) intern in summber 2022, worked on [nested tensor](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/nestedtensor)

👨‍🎓 I was a quantum chemistry Ph. D. from fall 2018 to fall 2022, researched to empower quantum chemistry with machine learning

👨‍🎓 I was a chemistry B. Sc. with physics minor from fall 2014 to summer 2018, deeply fascinated by quantum physics, and happy to accept Paul Dirac's challenge: "The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved."

🔭 Looking forward to make the world more computable:
* For large models that can only live on cloud currently, let's compress them and deploy to edge devices!
* For humongous challenges posted by nature and physical laws, that can't even live on cloud, let's develop some more efficient algorithms!
