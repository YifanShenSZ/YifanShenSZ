# Howdy, I'm Yifan Shen

I was a software engineer machine learning intern at Meta Platforms Inc. during summber 2022. I worked on PyTorch nested tensor operation support, see [nested tensor tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/nestedtensor)

I am a quantum chemistry Ph. D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University. I obtained my B. S. in chemistry and physics minor from Zhejiang University.

I am actively searching for a machine learning engineer or software engineer role. Any start time after November 2022 will work for me.
